# LoadToAgent

### One local command center for every AI agent at work.

Monitor Claude, Codex, Gemini, and Grok sessions, follow parent–subagent relationships, inspect token usage, and send work back to a connected terminal—without uploading your transcripts.

> Your agent transcripts stay on your computer. LoadToAgent reads the local session files created by the AI tools you already use.

## Install and run

Choose npm if you already use Node.js, or download a ready-to-run desktop file. Neither option requires a Git checkout.

### Option 1: npm

LoadToAgent is published on npm as [`loadtoagent`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/loadtoagent). Install it globally, then run the command to open the desktop dashboard:

```bash
npm install -g loadtoagent
loadtoagent
```

The npm method does not create a desktop shortcut. Run `loadtoagent` whenever you want to open the app. If your terminal cannot find the command immediately after installation, close and reopen the terminal once.

```bash
# Update
npm install -g loadtoagent@latest

# Remove
npm uninstall -g loadtoagent
```

### Option 2: desktop download

Open the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/minjund/LodeToAgent/releases/latest) and download the file for your computer. Node.js is not required for these files.

| System | Download | Start the app |
|---|---|---|
| Windows 10/11 (x64) | `LoadToAgent-<version>-portable.exe` | Double-click the downloaded file. It is portable and does not run an installer. |
| Apple silicon Mac | `LoadToAgent-<version>-arm64.dmg` | Open the DMG, drag LoadToAgent into Applications, then open it from Applications. |
| Intel Mac | `LoadToAgent-<version>-x64.dmg` | Open the DMG, drag LoadToAgent into Applications, then open it from Applications. |

The current desktop files are not code-signed. Windows SmartScreen or macOS Gatekeeper may show an unknown-developer warning. Continue only when the file came from this repository's official Releases page. On macOS, Control-click LoadToAgent and choose **Open**. On Windows, choose **More info → Run anyway**.

### Requirements

- macOS or Windows
- Node.js 18 or newer only when installing through npm
- At least one installed and authenticated CLI: Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, or Grok CLI
- tmux only if you want the optional tmux workspace map

## What LoadToAgent shows

| View | What you get |
|---|---|
| Agent map | Live work grouped by Claude, Codex, Gemini, and Grok |
| Relationship view | The request origin, selected agent, and every directly delegated subagent |
| Session detail | Conversation, tool activity, lifecycle events, model, workspace, and status |
| Token view | Input, output, cached, reasoning, total, and reported context-window usage |
| Terminal control | Local shell sessions plus safe command delivery to LoadToAgent-owned terminals |
| tmux workspace | Session → window → pane → AI process topology on macOS or Windows through WSL |

LoadToAgent distinguishes between a terminal it can control, a session that needs a bridge connection, a read-only session that must continue in its original app, and an ended session. It never types into an arbitrary external window.

## Use a connected terminal

Keep the LoadToAgent app open, then start an AI CLI through its authenticated local bridge:

```bash
loadtoagent run claude
loadtoagent run codex
loadtoagent run gemini
loadtoagent run grok
```

Arguments after `--` are passed to the provider CLI:

```bash
loadtoagent run claude -- --model claude-sonnet-4-6
```

The external terminal and LoadToAgent dashboard now control the same LoadToAgent-owned PTY. Existing sessions started elsewhere remain visible but read-only unless the original app exposes a supported handoff.

## Local-first by design

- Session files are read directly from your user profile.
- API key files are not read or displayed; authentication stays with each provider CLI.
- The terminal bridge uses a per-user token and a local named pipe or Unix domain socket.
- Renderer requests are isolated and validated before terminal or tmux actions run.
- Enabling workspace writes gives the selected AI permission to modify that folder, so use it only with repositories you trust.

Review the visible transcript before sharing your screen: agent conversations and tool inputs can contain sensitive project information.

## Develop locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
npm test
```

Additional checks and distributable builds:

```bash
npm run test:terminal
npm run test:bridge
npm run test:tmux -- macOS
npm run test:visual
npm run dist:mac
npm run dist:win
```

`dist:mac` produces Apple Silicon and Intel DMG/ZIP files. `dist:win` produces a portable Windows executable. Production macOS releases still require the maintainer's Apple signing and notarization credentials.

## Supported session sources

| Provider | Existing sessions | New work stream | Subagents |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude | Claude Code local JSONL transcripts | Structured headless output | Transcript subagent records |
| Codex | Codex local rollout JSONL files | `codex exec --json` | `thread_spawn` parent metadata |
| Gemini | Gemini local chat JSON/JSONL files | Structured streaming output | Parent IDs when reported |
| Grok | Grok local session JSON/JSONL files | Structured streaming output | Parent IDs when reported |

Provider event mappings and context-window rules are documented in [Provider Contracts](docs/PROVIDER-CONTRACTS.md).

## Release

Tagged GitHub releases run the full test suite, publish the npm package with provenance, build macOS and Windows artifacts, and attach them to the release. The package version and release tag must match.
